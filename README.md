This is my homegrown coding project to work with a Raspberry Pi and a camera, and make a motion-detecting camera.
This currently runs on a RasbperryPi3 with the standard (5MP) camera. 

I've pulled together various things from other people's blog posts, including some OpenCV 3. Most of it comes from the http://PyImageSearch.com site, but I've also added a bit of multithreading and done a bit of OO to bits of it. 

Anyone interested in contributing, let me know, and I'll be happy to chat with you. Producing a RPi image with OpenCV3 already installed would be a great boost forward for making more of these cameras without hours of installation work.
